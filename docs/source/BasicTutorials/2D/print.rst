Print direct:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This function prints the current drawing with the used printing device.

It cannot be used if “Custom formats” was chosen for the printing
device. In this case, the function “print” would be used automatically.

Print black/white:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The current drawing will be printed in black and white with the used
printing device.

It cannot be used if “Custom formats” was chosen for the printing

Print:
^^^^^^

Using this function, the printing window of your operating system will
pop up in order to ask for the printer and the paper size.

If another paper format is chosen than the one the drawing is created
in, the printed drawing can be bigger or smaller. A pop up window will
show the actual drawing size and it has options for adjusting the paper
size.

It is possible to print several drawings at once.

The US seldom uses “degrees” to define a roof pitch.

If you would prefer your roof pitch to be shown in (rise and run),
example “7/12” you can create drawing sections for this purpose and
store them in your library.

Here is an example I have in my library. This was created with lines and
single line text.

Feet & Inch input

Dietrich’s 2D‐Cad & 3D construction software

When using Dietrich’s D‐Cad 2D L (freeware) you can change the units you
want to work in for example meter or feet & inch by choosing units from
the menu bar. File, Settings, Units our by typing (1 7 4).

In Dietrich’s D‐Cad 2D and 3‐D Construction program (in every module)
you will find Units under File, Settings, Units or by typing (1 7 5).

Here are a few inch input examples using Draw, Lines, line (1 3 1).

Examples for 1/2” input:
