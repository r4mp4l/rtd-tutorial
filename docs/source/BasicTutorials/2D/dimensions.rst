Dimensions - From File. 
-----------------------


This chapter gives an overview of different dimension options in D-CAD
2D and explains how to use dimensions in general.

In order to turn the dimensions on and off easily, the layer should be
changed to “dimensions”.

Layer window

Angle dimension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This function dimensions the angle between two lines. For that purpose,
the lines have to be selected counter clockwise. When creating angle
dimensions, the color set and the style (with or without pointer) can be
selected.

Draw angle dimension window

Move the dimension text if it overlaps the angle dimension.

Another option is to click the “right mouse button” while highlighting
the angle dimension and to select “move text” in the pop up menu.

Height flags
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section explains how to create height flags. Height flags dimension
the height of selected points referenced to the point of origin of the
current coordinate system.

Furthermore, it is shown how to create user coordinate systems (UCS). It
is possible to have several user coordinate systems in addition to the
global coordinate system in one drawing. Each user coordinate systems
defines an individual point of origin. Therefore, it may be necessary to
update height flags in order to adjust them to a user coordinate system.

Height flag window

Create a height flag for the eave point in the front elevation.

Create a height flag for the ridge point in the front elevation.

In this section a user coordinate system will be created. The point of
origin is the left lower corner of the left post in the front elevation.

Window settings

Adjust the height flags to the current coordinate system (UCS 1) by
using the function “update”.

Horizontal baseline dimension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Baseline dimensions dimension all selected points referring to the
starting point. Create a horizontal baseline dimension in the front
elevation.

Next, a horizontal baseline dimension will be created in the side
elevation.

Align the dimension lines in both elevations.

Current view – horizontal baseline dimension

Horizontal distance dimension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Distance dimensions dimension the distance between the selected points.
Create a horizontal distance dimension in the front elevation.

Create a horizontal distance dimension in the side elevation.

Align the dimension lines in both elevations.

Current view – horizontal distance dimension

Insert further dimensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section shows how to add further dimensions to an existing
dimension line.

The dimension of the posts width in the front elevation will be added to
the horizontal distance dimension line.

Current view – insert further dimensions

Vertical baseline dimension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to dimension the pass line height, a vertical baseline
dimension will be created in the front view.

Current view – vertical baseline dimension

Aligned distance dimension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The function “angled distance dimension” will be used to dimension the
length of a wall brace.

Current view - aligned distance dimension

Radius dimension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The radius of the arc will be dimensioned on the opposite wall brace.

Current view - radius dimension

Quick dimension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The quick dimension is an automatically dimension function for all
dimensions. If this function is active, all points on the same level
between the starting and end point of a dimension line will be
dimensioned automatically.

The rafter spacing in the side elevation will be dimensioned by using
the horizontal distance dimension.
