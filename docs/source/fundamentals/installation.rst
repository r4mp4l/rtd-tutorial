2 Default Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dietrich’s Setup differentiates between **Default Installation** and
**User Defined Installation**. The user has no influence on a Default
Installation. It will install all necessary files and programs you need
for a Dietrich’s system with default path settings. The following will
describe the Default Mode in detail.

::

   The Default Mode is the recommended installation
   mode. The user may select the system language.
   This will define the language during installation and
   of the installed programs. In order to install, you
   have to accept the conditions of the license agree-
   ment.

2.1 Installation Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Depending on the availability of previously installed versions, set-up
will deter- mine what installation mode to use. The modes are Update,
New and Parallel. Dietrich’s Versions are recognized by the Desktop
Icons that exist. Finding exist- ing Dietrich’s Versions may require
some time.

**New Installation:** This mode will be chosen if a new appropriate
Dietrich’s Version has been detected.

**Parallel Installation:** This mode is available if an immediate
preceding Ver- sion has been detected (e.g. a Version 19 has to be
installed in order to make a parallel installation of Version 20 ).

**Update Installation:** An existing version can be updated only with a
newer Version of the same Version number (e.g. an existing Version 20
.01 can be updated to Version 20 .02).

2.2 Taking Over Saved Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The new version comes with a variety of changes and enhancements in the
saved settings. During Update and Parallel Installation the following
message will appear:

If you continue selecting – YES – all you previously saved settings from
existing program versions will not be lost. You will be able to access
then in all program modules via ( 1 - 3 - 4) **> File > Templates, Work
Environments> load Work Environment <**. The work environment will show
the date you installed the program. You can find it under:
:raw-latex:`\Work `Environments:raw-latex:`\ENG` (see picture).

If you continue selecting – No – in order to keep working with your own
settings, you will still be able to access the new settings from every
program module via (1- 3 - 4) **> File > Templates, Work Environments>
Load Work Environment <**. You will find the new settings under:
:raw-latex:`\Work `Environments:raw-latex:`\ENG`:raw-latex:`\Update20`
23 .

2.3 Main Data Base
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The installation mode set-up will determine what data base to use:

**New Installation:** During a New Installation the data base by default
will go to C::raw-latex:`\DHPDBA`. In addition, a back-up will go into a
sub di- rectory that shows the version number the d-base came from e.g.
’ENG 23 \_01’.

**Parallel Installation:** A Parallel Installation will use the same
d-base as the original Program Version. In addition, a back-up will go
into a sub directory that shows the version number the d-base came from
e.g. ’ENG 23 \_01’. All Program Versions that use the same path settings
for the d-base will be able to access it as well.

**Update Installation:** An Update Installation will use the existing
d-base. In addition, a back-up will go into a sub directory that shows
the version number the d-base came from e.g. ’ENG 23 \_01’. All Pro-
gram Versions that use the same path settings for the d-base will be
able to access it as well.

After successful completion, set-up will show a message window to
confirm that all files have been copied and registered.
